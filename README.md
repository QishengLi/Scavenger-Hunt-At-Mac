# Scavenger Hunt @ Mac
This is a desktop Scavenger Hunt game based on Macalester College campus map with a lovely storyline. 

## Getting Started
### System Requirements
- [Java Development Kit 7+ (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

### Build

First, clone the project
```
$ git clone https://github.com/QishengLi/game_gdx.git
```

Then, open it in Intellij and set up configurations. Please refer to the 'Configuring IntelliJ' section in this [configuration tutorial](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2014/03/26/Want-to-use-LibGDX-but-hate-Eclipse-Good-news-with-Gradle-IntelliJ-just-became-easier.aspx).

## How to play

Once you finish buid the game, you can launch the game by running ```DesktopLauncher``` class. You can use arrowkeys to navigate around the map, and use mouse to click on the button. 

## Future Work
This game can be improved in many ways. It currently has a foundational platform that could potentially incorporate more interesting game features. For example: 

- Players can collect food and drink while walking on the map
- Players can attack enemies
- Multi-chain of story lines
